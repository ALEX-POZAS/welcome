## Folders and filenames

- `img` folder : your picture in JPG format. The filename will be used to 
display your name. Choose it appropriately.
- `profile` folder : your presentation in HTML. Same for the 
*filename* (must be according to your picture).
- `konami` folder : do you know which is the Konami Code? Try executing it on the website!
- `index.php` : the main file, where all the actions takes place. Pretty awesome, right?
- `style.css` : the css file, where we put all the beauty in our files.

### PHP

```
	In this peace of code, first we assign to the *$imgs* variable the properties of the scan of the directory /img in an ascendent way.
